## 🧠 Project Overview
This repository documents my full journey of replicating, assembling, and upgrading Pia-the-Robot, based on the original open-source design.

The main objectives are:
1. Rebuild Pia using Raspberry Pi Pico and DF9GMS 180° servos
2. Study expressive movement and mechanical design
3. Understand servo kinematics
4. Document full assembly, wiring, and coding steps
5. Adapt Pia into a cost-effective Micro-RSC platform for my BSc thesis

This project is continuously updated.
